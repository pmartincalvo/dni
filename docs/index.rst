dni
===============================

Welcome to the docs for version |version|.

``dni`` is a small python package to make your life easier with Spanish Ids.
Currently, it supports the DNI specification. NIE and Spanish passports are
not supported at the moment.

Features include:

- Check validity of DNIs.
- Get check letter for a DNI number.
- Avoid primitive obsession with the DNI class. Get the components of the DNI,
  format it in different ways, check for equality.
- Find and extract multiple DNIs from text.
- Get detailed exceptions when a string has issues.
- Generate random, valid DNIs.
