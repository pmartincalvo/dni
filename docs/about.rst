The story
---------------

One day I was working with a CRM dataset and had to deal with a few
issues regarding Spanish DNI's.

I started rolling my own functions, and when things started to grow, I
thought to myself: "Wait. Someone probably implemented this already and I'm
wasting my time here".

It turns out nobody had implemented a library for dealing with DNIs properly in
Python, so I decided to build it myself.
